It has been over half a century since astrophysicist Sjur Refsdal
first developed the theory to enable the use of a gravitationally
lensed supernova (SN) resolved into multiple images as a cosmological
tool. The first multiply-imaged core-collapse (CC) and Type Ia SN,
Refsdal \nolink{\cite{Kelly:2015a}} and iPTF16geu \nolink{\cite{Goobar:2016}}
respectively, have been discovered in just the past 3 years. As the
light for each of the multiple images follows a different path through
the expanding universe and through the lensing potential, the SN
images appear delayed by hours (for galaxy-scale lenses) or years (for
cluster-scale lenses). These gravitational lenses are also important
tools for extending our SN sample into the early universe, beyond the
limit of current detections at $z\simeq2$. As PI on an ongoing HST
Archival Research Grant, \textbf{I am developing the first open-source
software for analysis of lensed SNe} (\textit{Supernova Time Delays}
[SNTD]).  This Python package will be essential for precise
measurements of lens properties and time delays from the hundreds of
multiply-imaged SN observations expected over the next decade (Figure
1), and despite its design for SNe will be valuable for lensed quasar
measurements as well. My research will have two major components:
1. Using SNTD and multiply-imaged SN as a cosmological
probe. 2. Observing and understanding the rates and physical
properties of very high-z SNe.

of $20,000deg^2$ LSST (Pink, $i_{peak,lim})$ and $20deg^2$ WFIRST
(Blue, $H_{peak,lim})$ surveys. With this huge volume of lensed CC and
Ia SN observations expected in the next decade, the open-source SNTD
package will be widely used and essential for analyzing this large
WFIRST/LSST SN sample (adapted from Oguri $\&$ Marshall
2010 \nolink{\cite{Oguri:2010a}}).}
\end{wrapfigure}
\noindent\underline{\textit{Intellectual Merit}} : After completing SNTD, I
will use the software to make more precise time delay measurements for
the two currently documented multiply-imaged SN, and any others
discovered in the interim. Accurate measurements of the lensing
magnification and time delays for strongly lensed CC SN Refsdal can be
used to test models for the dark matter distribution in the lensing
object \nolink{\cite{Rodney:2015a,Rodney:2016}} or as a probe to test
cosmological models \cite{Suyu:2014}. For a multiply-imaged Type Ia
SN such as iPTF16geu, more accurate measurements will provide both an
important milestone in breaking degeneracies in the lens model and a
measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ that is completely
independent of the local distance
ladder \nolink{\cite{Kolatt:1998,Oguri:2003b}}. The methodology and software I
develop will be \textbf{be widely used by future SN surveys} for
analyzing multiply-imaged SN and tightening the constraints found in
the course of this work.

Over the next 2 years, I will measure the rates and properties for a
sample of high-z and lensed SN discovered with
the Hubble Space Telescope. This sample will draw from a series of HST programs (CLASH, \href{https://frontierfields.org}{FrontierSN}, \href{https://relics.stsci.edu/}{RELICS}, and the new \href{http://buffalo.ipac.caltech.edu/}{BUFFALO} survey) that have targeted massive galaxy clusters. I am currently collaborating with the team of
Dr. Rogier Windhorst on the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO)
program 1176. Beginning in 2019, this program will apply 110 hours of
cadenced imaging on massive galaxy clusters as well as a deep field at
the North Ecliptic Pole.  The GTO should deliver over 300 SN
detections for $z<5$, including a significant portion above the
current detection limit of $z\simeq2$, as well as a chance for
observations of Type Ia and Pair Instability (PI) SNe at $z>5$ (Figure
2). In addition to spurring return observations with HST and JWST,
this new sample of high-z SNe alone will enable tests of star
formation rates (SFR), the stellar initial mass function (IMF), SN
progenitor pathways, and explosion models for SNe in the early
Universe.

Projected SN yield from the JWST GTO 1176 program. We will
detect \textit{every} Type Ia SN that explodes in this field to z
$\lesssim5$ and 90$\%$ of all Core Collapse (CC) SNe to z $\simeq$
1.5, allowing the first high-z SN rate studies with an effectively
complete sample. The green region represents redshifts above the most
distant SN currently recorded, suggesting that observations from the
GTO will create a significant catalog of the most distant SNe yet
detected. The inset shows SN yield for $z>5$, where observations of early universe
Type Ia and PI SNe are possible.}
\end{wrapfigure}

\noindent\underline{\textit{Research Plan}}:
1)Complete the python software package SNTD and write a paper
presenting its capabilities and validation. 2) Perform reanalysis of
SN Refsdal and SN iPTF16geu using SNTD, writing a second paper
presenting the more precise time delay measurements, detailing the
methodology required for these analyses, and obtaining an initial
constraint on $H_0$ from iPTF16geu. 3)Form a sample of high-z and
lensed SNe from HST surveys and JWST GTO, and write a paper using this
sample to constrain the physical properties of SN progenitors in the
early universe.

\textbf{Evidence for the success of this work} will come from these \textbf{three publications}, as well as the vetting and
extensive use of the open-source SNTD package by the entire community
throughout future work with the next generation of space telescopes.

\noindent\underline{\textit{Broader Impacts}}:
I will use my previous STEM outreach experiences (see personal
statement) to \textbf{increase the participation of young students in
astronomy and other STEM fields from my neighborhood in Columbia, SC,
where 88$\%$ of the residents are underrepresented minorities in
STEM.}  My research is a terrific gateway into STEM because it is
naturally exciting and interesting: space telescopes, exploding stars,
and gravitational lensing are surefire topics to capture the attention
and imagination of a young learner. I have already created a plan with
the \textit{Lyon Street Community After School Program} that
will include taking the kids to our local University observatory, and
leading them through a series of astronomical
exercises over the course of the year. I will have each student choose
and carry out an astronomy project within our neighborhood, such as
monitoring sunspots to measure the rotation of the sun, and present
their results to the community. By teaching the students and engaging
their parents via the research projects and presentations, this outreach
program will \textbf{ encourage higher learning in STEM, and increase
public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM}.
