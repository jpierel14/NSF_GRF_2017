It has  been over  half a century  since renowned  astrophysicist Sjur
Refsdal first hypothesized  the use of a supernova  (SN) resolved into
multiple images  as a  cosmological tool. In  recent years,  the first
multiply-imaged core-collapse (CC) SN Refsdal \citep{Kelly:2015a}, and
subsequently the first Type Ia SN iPTF16geu \citep{Goobar:2016}, have been discovered
(Figure 1A-C). As the light for each of the multiple images
follows a different path through the expanding universe and through
the lensing potential, the SN images appear delayed by hours (for
galaxy-scale lenses) or years (for cluster-scale lenses). For objects
like SN Refsdal, measurement of this time delay can be used as a
precise test of cluster lens models \citep{Treu:2015}. For a SN like
iPTF16geu, the time delay can lead to a \textbf{direct constraint on
the Hubble constant $H_0$}, that is completely independent of the
local distance ladder.  The next decade is expected to yield
observations of tens to hundreds of multiply-imaged
SNe \citep{Oguri:2010}, yet there is no public software package for
analyzing multiply-imaged SNe.

\noindent\underline{\textit{Intellectual Merit}} :
As the PI on an ongoing HST Archival Research Grant, \textbf{I am
developing the first open-source software package} in Python
(\textit{Supernova Time Delays} [SNTD]) that will enable a user to
precisely measure lens properties and time delays for the hundreds of
multiply imaged SNe expected in the LSST/WFIRST era (Figure 1D).  Properties of
dark energy and dark matter are still poorly understood and
inadequately constrained, but measurement of the lensing magnification
and time delays can be used to test models for the dark matter
distribution in the lensing object \citep{Rodney:2015a,Rodney:2016} or
as a probe to test cosmological models \citep{Suyu:2014}.  To that
end, I will first use SNTD to make more precise
time delay measurements for the two currently documented multiply
imaged SNe. SN iPTF16geu is Type Ia, so by providing a more accurate
time delay and luminosity distance measurement, I will be able to
accomplish two critical goals. First, directly measuring the source
magnification will provide an important milestone in breaking
degeneracies in the lens model \citep{Kolatt:1998,Oguri:2003b}.
Second, precise determinations of the time delays for a multiply
imaged Type Ia SN will provide a constraint on $H_0$, and the
methodology and software I develop will be \textbf{essential to future
SN surveys} for tightening those constraints. Between SN iPTF16geu and
SN Refsdal, I will be able to validate SNTD and the
methodology I am developing for time delay measurements, and provide
these tools for the next generation of observations with JWST, WFIRST,
and LSST.

JWST will measure light curves for some of the earliest SN explosions
in the universe. Colored curves depict theoretical explosions from Pop
III SNe, and a dashed horizontal line shows the nominal detection
limit for JWST. These simulated light curves show that these first
stars are detectable by JWST, which makes their inclusion in SNTD
essential to future work(Figure adopted from Whalen et al. 2013b).}
\end{wrapfigure}

Observations either  by way of  gravitational lensing, or by  the next
generation telescope  JWST, will  provide a  sample of  extremely high
redshift SNe (Figure 2). Of  interest in the early  universe are pair-instability
(PI) and  Population III (Pop III)  SNe. \textbf{Understanding
these first stars  is crucial to a wide range  of cosmology, including
the  formation of  primeval galaxies,  initial stages  of cosmological
reionization,    and     the    origin    of     Supermassive    black
holes}  \citep{Whalen:2013}.Therefore,  I  will collect  a  sample  of
current high-z  and gravitationally  lensed SNe, and  begin discerning
the properties of these first stars. In addition to searching for, and
studying the physics of PI and Pop III SNe, I will include theoretical
light curve templates  for both objects in the  open-source software I
am developing, so that future  observations can be identified and both
lens properties and progenitor physics  studied. Not all SNe found and
analyzed will be strongly lensed and valuable for identifying lens and
dark energy properties or dark  matter distribution. Therefore, I will
also  collect a  sample  of  these weakly  lensed  SNe, and  carefully
measure their magnification in order  to make small corrections in the
Hubble   diagram.

\noindent\underline{\textit{Research Summary}}:
First, I will complete the python software package SNTD, and write a
publication presenting its capabilities and validation. Next I will
perform the reanalysis of SN Refsdal and SN iPTF16geu using SNTD,
writing a second publication presenting the more precise time delay
measurements, detailing the methodology required for these analyses,
and obtaining a constraint on $H_0$ from iPTF16geu. Finally, I will
add theoretical light curves for PISN and POP III SNe to the SNTD
package, and obtain a gravitationally lensed SN sample to study the
physics of these first stars. With the weaker lensed objects, I will
perform Hubble diagram magnification adjustments. From this last
component of my research, I will complete two further publications:
one describing magnification corrections for Hubble diagram SNe and
their affect on $H_0$, and the other the detailing search for, and
ideally discovery of, PISNe and POP III SNe and their physical
properties. These four publications will be a clear measure of the
success of this work, and the software and methodologies developed
during the course of my research will be crucial tools for future work
using the next generation of space telescopes.

\noindent\underline{\textit{Broader Impacts Summary}}:
The SNTD software package will  be a crucial tool in years to
come, as the  next generation of telescopes  drastically increases our
catalogue of multiply  imaged SNe. Improving our  understanding of the
first stars will be essential to various branches of cosmology such as
the origin  of supermassive black holes,  and I will pave  the way for
future PISN and POP III SN observations by including their theoretical
templates in SNTD, and search for  the first POP III SN observation by
forming a sample of strongly  lensed SNe. Finally, by documenting SNTD
and my improved measurement of  the Refsdal and iPTF16geu time delays,
I will  provide a constraint  on $H_0$ and a  standardized methodology
that will be used for future SN observations to tighten constraints on
$H_0$ and dark energy properties.
