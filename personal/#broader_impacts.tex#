\underline{\textit{Broader Impacts: }}
Due to my experience with educators suppressing my academic interests at a young age, I am committed to
ensuring that no child's love of astronomy will go unfostered in my
community. It is crucial that childen who love STEM, and specifically
astronomy, are reinforced that this is a valid future career and that
a graduate degree is possible for them. Growing up in rural Maine,
graduate degrees were few and far between, and even the percentage of
high school graduates attending a 2-4 year college was only around
50$\%$. In my current community within Columbia, SC according to
City-Data.com, \textbf{only $27\%$ of people graduated from high
school, $13\%$ have a bachelor's degree, $3\%$ have a master's degree,
and $0\%$ have a PhD.} I will use my STEM outreach experiences with
NASA's ARSET program, as well as the techniques I learned volunteering
in elementary school math classrooms in college and tutoring high
school students while at Goddard, to help foster excitement for STEM
in my community. I have already discussed my plans with the local
after-school program leader, who was very excited to implement a
framework to encourage astronomy and STEM learning. By taking kids to
our local University observatory, and leading them through a series of
exciting and educational astronomical exercises throughout the year, I
hope to convince these students that \textbf{achieving higher degrees
is possible and valuable}, and break the viscious cycle of supressed
academic opportunities forming in my community.
